### Introduction 

Project-induced displacement and resettlement are some of the serious effects of the construction of infrastructures. Large-scale development or infrastructure projects typically require land, and sometimes very large tracts of land. This need for land can result in the dislocation of the people living there (Frank, 2017). Even in situations where people are not required to physically move, the project may still impact their livelihoods or income-generating activities (IFC 2002), or cause other environmental and social impacts that make continuing to live there untenable. Project-induced resettlement can occur on a massive scale, for example, there were nearly 1.13 million people had to be relocated to the Three Gorges Dam in China. Also, the process can be complex because of varying vulnerabilities, capacities, positioning, and interests, the people being resettled are affected in different ways (Oliver-Smith 2010; Vanclay 2012). The methods are used to understand and analyze project-induced displacement study are DEM (digital elevation model) and also social-economic census data.

### Problem Statement 

Resettlement actions are sometimes considered as being ‘projects within projects’ (Reddy et al. 2015) because of its massive scale and complexity. Thus, the way forward in improving the project-induced resettlement and mitigating the impacts are needed.
