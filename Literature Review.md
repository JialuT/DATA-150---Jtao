## How RS and GIS are contributing to our understanding of the problems in EIA. 

### Introduction 

The Environmental Impact assessment (EIA) is a decision-making tool intended to inform development decisions by mandating a consideration of alternatives and ways to prevent, mitigate, and control potential negative environmental and social impacts (Jennifer, 2008). It was originated in the United States in the late 1960s when people realized some significant environmental problems in the United States resulted from actions of conducting infrastructures itself. The scope of the term “environment” is broader than just biophysical environment. EIAs were meant to include all non-monetary impacts (i.e., impacts not included in a benefit-cost analysis) (Leonard & Anne, 1995). In other words, the focus is not just on scientific studies or environmental impact statements, it is on improving decisions. With the availability of the cutting-edge technology, EIA process has been improved. This literature review begins by discussing the challenges in EIA process and then describes how geospatial technology improves it especially. Subsequently, a case study of Three Gorges Project (TGP) in China will be discussed in detail about how remote sensing is contribute to the understanding of the population displacement.  

### Challenges are faced 

Although the EIA process is regarded as a first and foremost decision-making aid, there are still many obstacles we faced that will frustrate the effectiveness of this process. In the article *Environmental Impact Assessment: Challenges and Opportunities written by Leonard and Anne*, the authors list and analyze nine perennial problems in EIA implementation and also three new EIA and international environmental problems ranging from policy to technics. In general, the authors conclude that all of the problems fall into two types: systemic problems and secondary problems that are easier to solve. 

Firstly, the major systemic problems are (1) EIA is typically conducted as a one-time exercise, whereas the process of project design is cyclical and interactive (2) the EIA exercise is often conducted late in planning, often long after project proponents have become attached to a particular design concept (Leonard & Anne, 1995). These two problems lead the EIA can only propose the potential mitigation measurement instead of proposing or even mandating alternatives for the project, which violates the initial intention of having EIA. However, the difficulty of solving the first problem is it is hard to define the scope of a program when all of the decisions will often change and evolve which involves a lot of decision-making authorities. 

Secondly, the problems authors think is more amenable to a solution are (1) cumulative impacts are not assessed frequently (2) public participation in EIA is often inadequate (3) post-project monitoring, assessments of risk and social impacts are often omitted from EIAs (Leonard & Anne, 1995). These problems can be solved with the improvement of technology and also related policy. 

Cumulative impacts are defined as the “result of additive and aggregative actions producing impacts that accumulate incrementally or synergistically over time and space” (Contant and Wiggins 1993: 341). In the article *Environmental Impact Assessments in Developing Countries: An Opportunity for Greater Environmental Security?* written by Jennifer C. Li., the author states that the assessment of cumulative impacts is one of the most important challenges for EIAs. The reason is that many projects might pose minor risks to the environment in and of themselves but pose a significant risk to the environment in combination with other activities (Odum,1982). However, because of the methodological difficulties. It is hard to perform the assessment frequently. 

Inadequate public participation is another problem. Public involvement occurs too late to take advantage fully of information that citizens can contribute concerning values, impacts, and alternative projects (Leonard & Anne, 1995). Also, Jennifer C. Li (2008) notes that in developing countries, EIAs most often lack a public announcement or “notice of intent” advising about the imminent preparation of an EIA, a well-designed process for involving the public, and post-EIA monitoring. However, despite its advantages, we have to admit there are reasonable factors of why increase public participation in some countries is harder than the others such as the institutional context, funds, and the population. 

Leonard et al also mention the challenge of international development assistance that there’s a need to implement the new EIA requirements in a way that is both productive and sensitive to the local context (Leonard & Anne, 1995). This perspective is also presented in the lecture Development and Complexity taught by Owen Barder who suggests in a complex adaptive system, we need to avoid “isomorphic mimicry” which only creates something that looks like a good one but to take the local situation into account. Ann Hironaka (2002) concludes that because EIAs have been introduced into developing countries largely as a result of an internationally driven and mostly top-down process, they have been adopted more as a standardized, bureaucratized, procedural formality than as a real solution for intertwined environmental and socio-economic problems. 

To sum up, although the article written by Leonard and Anne was published in 1995, it still provides an overview of the problems in two types. The second type of the challenges can be improved easily. 

### Technologies are applied 

Leonard et al define the problems that can be solved with the availability of new technologies as more amenable to solution. In this part of the literature review, I will first discuss the general steps involved in the EIA process and then two technologies, remote sensing (RS) and geographical information system (GIS), that are frequently being used and how they improve the EIA process. 

The general steps in the EIA process are designed to ensure all problems and potential linkages can be presented. To are more specific, it includes (a) screening which is done to determine whether or not a proposal should be subject to EIA (Anjali et al, 2016) (b) scoping that identify the key issues of concern at an early stage in the planning process (Ahmed & Sammy, 1987) (c) an EIA report (consideration of alternatives, identification of major impacts, and mitigation measures) (Jennifer, 2008) (d) public participation and (e) review. A visualization of this structure is presented in Figure 1.
