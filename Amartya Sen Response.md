1. What is development?

Development can be seen as a process of expanding the real freedoms that people enjoy. Although some people regard some indexes like the growth of GNP as a direct message of a country's development, it is the real freedoms(for example, the opportunity to receive basic education) that allow and contribute to the growth of GNP and also many other forms of development. 

2. Is this an expansive or narrower view of development? 

Seeing development as a process of expanding real freedoms is an expansive view of development. This is because freedom is a constituent component of development and is both the means and the ends that make development important. The narrower view is to see it as only the means like modernization, industrialization, or technological advance. 

3. What are some of sources of unfreedoms development requires being removed?

The most intrinsic source of unfreedom is economic poverty which means that people who suffer from economic poverty lack the means necessary to meet basic personal needs and sometimes can not even survive let alone thrive. Also, another source is the neglect of public facilities and social care which includes the absence of health care and educational facilities. Thirdly, the denial of political liberty and basic civil rights will also take a toll on a country's development. To be more specific, the author mentions "Lee thesis" which denies the importance of rights. This thesis can be proved to be wrong easily according to many historical records such as the deadliest famine in history, the great Chinese famines 1959-1961, took place because of the drastic changes to farming policy and prohibition of farm ownership.Â
