Introduction

Introducing what Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) is and its importance. 
The limitation of the original EIA report of the Three Gorges Project (TGP). 
What are possible way forwards for the original EIA report of TGP in respect to the geospatial technology, especially in population displacement. 
The importance to discuss the population displacement. 

Body 1 Difficulties are faced 

The process of EIA. 
Comparing with the developed countries, developing countries may exhibit several problems and difficulties in EIA process. 

Body 2 Remote sensing and GIS in EIA

Introducing what is remote sensing and GIS. 
How applying these technologies can benefit and advantage the EIA process. 

Body 3 Three Gorges Project

Difficulties and problems of the EIA process in TGP in China.
Introducing the population displacement in the three gorges reservoir area and the reasons of additional displacements that the original EIA report didnâ€™t predict.  

Body 4 

Focusing on a specific hazard or problem that leads to additional displacement, such as landslides, seismic hazard, or cropland changes. 
Discussing how geo-special data can benefit our understanding and maybe improvements of one of the difficulties above. 

Conclusion

The benefits of applying those technologies into EIA process. 
To better improve population displacement issue, it is needed to take other aspects into account, such as policy.
