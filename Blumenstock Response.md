1. Promise 
* data from mobile phones have transformed consumer lending in many developing countires who use machine-learning algorithm detect the patterns and spit out credit scores for people. 
  1. Digital credit has the potential to dramatically lower transactioni costs. 
  2. Loans can be disbursed immediately
  3. It is possible to extend credit to large groups of indivisuals without collateral or traditional scores.
* Data Can be used to match resources to people living in poverty
* Data can also be used to generate high-resolution maps of crop yields and childhood malnutrition.
* distribute humanitarian aid
* Analysis of people's footprints could improve public-health interventions. 

2. pitfall
* unanticipated effects 
  microcredit: it is unclear that whether hese lans help people. Many digital-credit customers are first-time borrowers and unclear about the terms of theloans which may lead to poverty cycles. 
* Lack of validatioin
  1. Do not well tested and do not always generalize. 
  2. The algorithms may not remain accurate over time because the relationship between the phone use and other things can change. 
  3. When people aware their personal data are being monitored to make decisions, they are inevitably incentivized to game the system. For example, if an instructor releases the complete source code for an algorithm grading student essays, it becomes easy for students to exploit loopholes in the code:
* Biased algorithms 
  The most disadvantaged people tend to be the least represented in new sources of digital data
* Lack of regulation
  Since private companies have little incentive to do anything except maximize profits, regulation is needed. However, in many develoing nations, those regulations that do exist are seldom enforced. 
  
3. Ways forwad
* Validate 
  New sources of data should complement, not replace, old ones. 
* Customize
  Further customization is needed like take local context into account. 
* Deepen collaboration
  Increase technical capacity locally. 

4. other
* transparency: process all data, revealing the source code, inputs, and outputs of the algorithm
                transparency can backfire if not implemented carefully
